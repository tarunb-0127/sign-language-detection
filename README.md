# Sign Language Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a real-time Sign Language Detection system using OpenCV and deep learning. The goal is to bridge communication gaps by translating hand gestures from sign language into text or speech, making communication more accessible for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Captures video input and processes hand gestures in real-time.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a neural network trained to recognize sign language alphabets or words.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface to facilitate easy use and interaction.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include more gestures or different sign languages.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarunb-0127/sign-language-detection.git
   cd sign-language-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the application**: Upon running the script, your webcam will be activated, and the system will begin detecting hand gestures.
2. **View the output**: The detected sign language gestures will be displayed as text on the screen.

## Dataset

- The model is trained on mnist dataset, which includes a diverse set of hand gestures representing various sign language alphabets.

## Model

- The deep learning model is a [mention the architecture, e.g., CNN-based model] designed to accurately classify hand gestures. It was trained using [mention the framework, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch].
